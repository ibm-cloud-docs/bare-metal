# Managing spare pools 
{: #access-spare-pools}

The Spare Pool screen in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} allows a user to manage the spare pool of devices that are associated with an account. Each device, or hot spare, in the spare pool can be used as a backup device if the primary device fails. Devices must be designated as hot spares on the Spare Pool screen before being used in this process. The Spare Pool screen can be accessed only by users with specific permission. To gain permission, contact the account's administrator. Complete the following steps to access the Spare Pool screen in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}.
