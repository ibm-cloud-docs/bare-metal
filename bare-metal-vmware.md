{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} provides the unique capability for you to provision dedicated
{{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} upon which you can deploy your own VMware based private cloud. For example, you can enable the
creation of a hybrid cloud where on-premises VMware based servers, tooling, and processes can be extended into the public cloud. For more
information, see [Getting started with VMware and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/infrastructure/vmware?topic=VMware-vmware-getting-started#vmware-getting-started).
