# End of support add-ons considerations
{: #eos-os-addon-bm-classic-intro}

If you have software add-ons that are at or past its end-of-support (EOS) date, security and stability risks are possible. The vendor no longer provides updates or security fixes for deprecated add-on versions.
{: short-desc}

Follow the guidance from your software add-on vendor on when to upgrade. IBM速 doesn't require you to use supported software add-ons, but you assume the risks that are associated with using outdated software add-ons. Unsupported add-ons don't receive security updates or fixes. Risks with using outdated software addons can include security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues. Plan to modernize your instances' software add-ons before the EOS date. For more information, see [Lifecycle for operating systems and add-ons](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-product-lifecycle-classic).

## Wanclouds&reg; partnership
{: #partner-bm-classic}

IBM has a partnership with Wan clouds. Contact [Wanclouds&reg;](https://wanclouds.net/ibm/request){: external} for more information. Using Wanclouds&reg; support incurs extra costs.

## End of Support (EOS) announcements
{: #bm-classic-eos-announcements}

End of Support (EOS) is the last date that {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} delivers standard support for a version or release of a product. The end of support date is aligned to the vendor and community support dates. The EOS date is also the effective date that the product ceases to exist (is deprecated) and can no longer be ordered or purchased.
