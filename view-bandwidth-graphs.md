## Overview

Bandwidth graphs display public and private network usage for all network traffic that is associated with your device for a time period. Follow these steps to view bandwidth graphs for your device:

## Before you begin
* Navigate to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/bare-metal?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Ensure you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.

For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/iam?topic=iam-infrapermission#infrapermission) and [Managing device access](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).

## View bandwidth graphs

1. Access the **Device List**.
2. Click **Device Name** to access the device.
3. Click the **Bandwidth** tab.
4. Select the type of network usage (public or private) from the **View** drop-down list.
5. Select the time period for the graph from the **View By** drop-down list.<br/>**Note:** Preset date ranges are most commonly queried. For a custom date range, select **Custom Date Range**.
6. Select the start and end dates from the corresponding drop-down calendars.
7. Click **Draw Graph**.

## What happens next

The graph appears under the selected details, displaying the requested data for the time range in Bits per Second (bps).
