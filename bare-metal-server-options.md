# Bare metal server options
{: #about-bm}

Your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} bare metal server is an hourly or monthly, single-tenant server that is dedicated to you. Your server isn't shared in any part, including server resources, with other customers. You manage your server, which is provisioned without a hypervisor, and deployed in one or more data centers. Multiple {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} can communicate on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} virtual private network as if stationed on the same rack.

## Servers for every workload
{: #servers-every-need}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} has {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} to fit every workload. For more information, see [Bare metal servers](https://www.ibm.com/products/bare-metal-servers){: external}.

### Fast provisioning servers
{: #Popular-bm}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offers preconfigured servers that meet the needs of most use cases. These servers are considered "fast provision" because your compute options (number of cores, speed, RAM, and number of drives) are preset. Preset servers are ready to configure 30 - 40 minutes after provisioning.

### Custom-based servers
{: #custom-based-bm}

If a fast-provisioning server doesn't meet your workload needs, you can customize your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} to meet your needs. Customized servers are generally provisioned in 2 - 4 hours. The provisioning time depends on complexity, quantity, and testing options.

### Network redundancy
{: #bm-network-redundancy}

Port redundancy provides a networking failover by maintaining a primary and secondary network port. If the primary port fails, the secondary (redundant) port enables.

Only one port is active at a time.
{: note}

The following network redundancy options are available for bare metal servers.

| Redundancy options | Description |
| ---- | ----|
| Automatic redundancy (Recommended option) | Automatically configures the redundant ports for interface teaming through LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) to preserve connectivity during routine maintenance. |
| User-managed redundancy | Interface teaming must be configured on the host operating system to use network redundancy. Without interface teaming, connectivity during routine maintenance is not preserved. |
| No redundancy | This option is not recommended.|
| Interface teaming (link aggregation)| Combines, in parallel, multiple network connections to provide redundancy and increase network throughput. |
{: caption="Network redunancy options" caption-side="top"}
