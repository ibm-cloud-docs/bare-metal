# Data centers overview
{: #bm-data-centers-overview}

When you select a data center, you want to keep latency to a minimum. So, you typically select a data center location that is closest to where your workloads are located. If you see a location that has multiple selections (example: DAL05, DAL06, DAL07), these data centers are part of a multi-zone region (MZR). MZRs make sure that you have high availability and capacity within these regions.

Choosing one data center over another in the same region does not offer different capabilities.

The following data centers are available for your provisioning needs.
