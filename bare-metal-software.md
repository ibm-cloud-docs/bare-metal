{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} has strategic relationships with vendors to provide month-to-month licenses
on 32-bit and 64-bit compatible software. When you order a device, you select the type of operating system and software for your device.
You can add more software to your device within the customer portal and change to another operating system by performing an OS reload
on your existing device. The IBM automated system provisions software onto your server by using best practice
guidelines of each vendor to ensure maximum stability and availability. For more information,
see [About Software](/docs/infrastructure/software?topic=software-getting-started).
